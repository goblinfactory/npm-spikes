# npm-spikes
Random experiments testing using npm as build tool inspired by  keithamus's https://github.com/keithamus/npm-scripts-example. 

I want to try to build my own up scripts as I need them step by step with very few files. 

Random notes:

##bundling

I've decided to use browserify for bundling, since it's the tool that's used in the npm-script example. Also, found this article 
[moving from requirejs to browserify](http://orizens.com/wp/topics/a-journey-from-require-js-to-browserify/) and it indicates that browserify is a step up from require.js, not knowing any better, I'm going to go with that as a placeholder start.
