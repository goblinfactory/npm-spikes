#BRANCH : CONCAT

##bundling - using concat & custom js file.

I've decided to use browserify for bundling,  since it's the tool that's used in the npm-script example. Also, found this article 
[moving from requirejs to browserify](http://orizens.com/wp/topics/a-journey-from-require-js-to-browserify/) and it indicates that browserify is a step up from require.js, not knowing any better, I'm going to go with that as a placeholder start.

For my first experiment though I've used concat as a very poor man's browserify, lol! ...and a custom javascript file to call concat (build-concat.js) manually concat two test files. 

I'm new to GIT so am a bit concerned I'm going to get myself all muddled up, forget that I'm on a branch, so this will be fun to test out.
